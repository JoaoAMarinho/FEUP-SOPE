b) Starvation:
Starvation is a problem which is closely related to both, Livelock and Deadlock. In a dynamic system, requests for resources keep on happening.
Thereby, some policy is needed to make a decision about who gets the resource when.
This process, being reasonable, may lead to a some processes never getting serviced even though they are not deadlocked.

A deadlock is a state in which each member of a group of actions, is waiting for some other member to release a lock.
A livelock on the other hand is almost similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in a livelock constantly keep on changing with regard to one another, none progressing.
Thus Livelock is a special case of resource starvation, as stated from the general definition, the process is not progressing.
